# Club Penguin
Hi there, my name is Cassie and I've been a fan of Club Penguin since I discovered it in 2008! I recently decided that I wanted to play all of the minigames so I've set about recreating them from the files scattered around the internet. If you have any requests for games do let me know as I'm currently just slowly working through them all.

Currently, I'm unsure as to how to create games that are multiplayer as it's difficult to work around the code, but if you know more than me please drop me a message.

# Currently Working Games
Here's a comprehensive list of all the minigames I have sorted so far:
 * Aqua Grabber
 * Astro Barrier
 * Bean Counters
 * Cart Surfer
 * Ice Fishing (both regular and grey mode bundled together)
 * Pizzatron 3000
 * PSA
   * Case of the Missing Puffles
   * G's Secret Mission
   * Case of the Missing Coins
   * Avalanche Rescue
   * Secret of the Fur
   * Questions for a Crab
   * Clockwork Repairs
   * Mysterious Tremors
   * Operation: Spy and Seek
   * Waddle Squad
   * The Veggie Villain
 * Puffle Rescue
 * Thin Ice

# Games left to create
Here's a list of all the minigames I think I can sort but haven't gotten around to yet:
 * Catchin' Waves
 * Card Jitsu - Sensei battle
 * Dance Contest
 * DJ3K
 * Puffle Roundup

Me again! Just a quick update to say I figured out the Ice Fishing files so both classic and grey mode can now both be played from one game file!!! Simply select grey mode on the main menu to catch those elusive grey fish :DDD I hope you're as excited about that as I am, waddle on!

I have now finished working through all of the missions and have uploaded them, as far as I can tell there are no graphical glitches or load errors but if you find any be sure to let me know!

# Cassie's Update - 18/09/23
So I've now worked through most of the games and some of the missions, and I've had a pretty good idea. What if I could combine all of the missions into one big continuous mission that you can slowly progress through?

Personally, I think I have the knowledge to create such a thing but I'd love to get some opinions.
