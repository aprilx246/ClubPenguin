# Club Penguin
Hi there, my name is Cassie and I've been a fan of Club Penguin since I discovered it in 2008! I recently decided that I wanted to play all of the minigames so I've set about recreating them from the files scattered around the internet. If you have any requests for games do let me know as I'm currently just slowly working through them all.

Currently, I'm unsure as to how to create games that are multiplayer as it's difficult to work around the code, but if you know more than me please drop me a message.

# Currently Working Games
Here's a comprehensive list of all the minigames I have sorted so far:
 * Aqua Grabber
 * Astro Barrier
 * Bean Counters
 * Cart Surfer
 * Catchin' Waves
 * Ice Fishing (both regular and grey modes bundled together)
 * Pizzatron 3000
 * PSA
   * Case of the Missing Puffles
   * G's Secret Mission
   * Case of the Missing Coins
   * Avalanche Rescue
   * Secret of the Fur

Today I've been working on cracking that infinite loop problem. Most games don't loop, you play, you win, the game exits out. It's a real issue if you're just playing them on your desktop because it means you have to reload the file every time. Most games being the key phrase.

All I've got in today's update is Catchin' Waves which I've gotten working pretty well (red puffle included). Lately, I've been working on another Club Penguin project so fixing the minigames hasn't been my main priority but I still want to get them all done. On a side note, I'd love to make the games all infinite loops. In OG Club Penguin when you finished a minigame you'd exit back to the island, get your coins, and move on with your life. But seeing as these minigames are separate you can't exit back to the island and usually, the games end with a white screen. I'm sure it must be possible to send you back to the beginning once you finish a game but it might take a lot of lines of code.
Anyway, I'm sure I'll figure it all out soon enough!

Me again! Just a quick update to say I figured out the Ice Fishing files so both classic and grey mode can now both be played from one game file!!! Simply select grey mode on the main menu to catch those elusive grey fish :DDD I hope you're as excited about that as I am, waddle on!

# Cassie's Update - 19/09/23
I have now finished working through all of the missions and have uploaded them, as far as I can tell there are no graphical glitches or load errors but if you find any be sure to let me know!

# Cassie's Update - 18/09/23
So I've now worked through most of the games and some of the missions, and I've had a pretty good idea. What if I could combine all of the missions into one big continuous mission that you can slowly progress through?

Personally, I think I have the knowledge to create such a thing but I'd love to get some opinions.
