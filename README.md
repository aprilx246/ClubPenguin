# Club Penguin
Hi there, my name is Cassie and I've been a fan of Club Penguin since I discovered it in 2008! I recently decided that I wanted to play all of the minigames so I've set about recreating them from the files scattered around the internet. If you have any requests for games do let me know as I'm currently just slowly working through them all.

Currently, I'm unsure as to how to create games that are multiplayer as it's difficult to work around the code, but if you know more than me please drop me a message.

# Currently Working Games
Here's a comprehensive list of all the minigames I have sorted so far:
 * Aqua Grabber
 * Astro Barrier
 * Cart Surfer
 * Ice Fishing (both regular and grey mode)
 * Pizzatron 3000
 * PSA
   * Case of the Missing Puffles
   * G's Secret Mission
   * Case of the Missing Coins
   * Avalanche Rescue 
 * Puffle Rescue
 * Thin Ice

So I've now worked through most of the games and some of the missions, and I've had a pretty good idea. What if I could combine all of the missions into one big continuous mission that you can slowly progress through?

Personally, I think I have the knowledge to create such a thing but I'd love to get some opinions.
